    <p>
        When you hear the name Cadillac Connectors, there may be some terms that come to mind. For us, those terms are
        <b>local</b>, <b>skills</b>, and <b>teamwork</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>LOCAL:</h3>
    <p>
        Everything the Cadillac Connectors do is based for and around our community. Our program draws kids from
        the greater cadillac area and allows them to learn about STEM surrounded by their peers. Our program also uses sponsors
        from our area to fund our team every year.
    </p>
    <h3>SKILLS:</h3>
    <p>
        The kids that come through our program learn valuable problem solving skills that can be used in any occupation, not
        just STEM related fields. When something goes wrong on our robot, quick thinking and creativity help us to solve the
        problem. Everyone involved learns these skills and can keep them into their transition into the workforce.
    </p>
    <h3>TEAMWORK:</h3>
    <p>
        Our team is exactly that - a team. No one person is responsible for everything. Through cooperation, we are
        able to accomplish innumerably more than any person alone. Because of this prevalence of teens working together,
        everyone who walks through our door has the opportunity to develop better communication and teamwork skills.
